Since it is my first time to use git so i was reading about what is git, how does it woprks and was is it used for
Today i was reading about the commands that are being used in git and how to use them or when to use them so i now i have a little bit of understanding git 
Since i have a clue about git a read about branches, wich are the complete set of repository files and why to you need to have them
I have looked at fork, pull request and tracked files and in fork i find some difficulties because i ddint know where am i going to find a file to fork but i did maanaged
I looked at cloning wich i find it the much easier to do because its about coping and copy what you need to copy to find everything about repository
Since now i enjoy using git i was looking at commit command and i didnt find any problem with it but i have to keep in mind that i need to write commit in a present tense and it must be straite forward
Now i mam bussy looking at push request and and pull request wich i think they will be like easier to do.
